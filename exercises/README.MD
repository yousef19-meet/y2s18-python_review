## Python Review Exercises

### 1.1: For Loops Review

In `for_loops.py`, use a for loop to print the sum
of the first 100 numbers from 1 to 100. 

Running `python for_loops.py` should print the sum of
the numbers.

When you're done, check your answers with a partner!

If you finish early, check out how to print the sum of only
the even numbers, from 1 to 100, without using an if statement!
**Hint:** The built-in range function might be useful here!

### 1.2: Conditionals Review

Now, instead of printing the sum of all the numbers from 1-100,
use an `if statement` to print the sum of only the even numbers
from 1-100.

Running "python conditionals.py" should print the sum of the numbers.

When you are done, check your answer with a partner.

If you finish early, find the largest number, less than 1,000, which
has a remainder of 2, when divided by 6, and whose cube has a remainder
of 3 when divided by 5

### 1.3: While Loops Review

Now, use a while loop to compute the sum of `1, 2, 3...` until
the sum is at least 10,000. How many numbers do you need?

Running `python while_loops.py` should print the largest number
required.

When you are done, check your answers with a partner!

If you finish early, figure out how many numbers are needed, if you're
only adding up even numbers!

### 1.4: Functions Review

Create a function named is_prime, which takes in a variable x, and
returns whether x is prime or not. To determine whether x
is prime, we can try dividing by every possible
number that's smaller than x.

Running `python functions.py` should print out whether 5,191 is
prime or not.

### 1.5 Classes Review

**Part 1:** Create a class Superheros, where each
superhero can be initialized with a name (a string),
a superpower (a string), and their strength (an integer).

**Part 2:** Write a function to print out the superhero's name and
strength.

**Part 3:** Sometimes, superheros use up a lot of
strength to save someone. Write a function `save_civilian`,
which takes in an input variable `work`, which is an integer
and reduces the superhero's strength by `work`. That is,
if `work=3`, and `strength=5`, then after saving the person,
the superhero will have 2 strength points left.

**Part 4:** Edit your function, so that if the work required
is greater than the strength of the superhero, the function
prints `Superhero is not strong enough! :(`

### 1.6 Imports Review

In `imports.py`, import the `random` module, from Python! The documentation
for this module can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

Use the `randint` function, from the `random` module, to generate
a random integer from 0 to 10.

### 1.7 Lab!

If you finish any of the previous sections early, go into the
`lab` folder, and work on the Python Review lab!
